## Advent of Code 2022

See [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com)

### Overview

My daily solutions from the 2022 Advent of Code. Done in Scala 3. Apologies, it's not immensely idiomatic. I have not used Scala in a while and this is a way to get back on the horse. There is a fair amount of "mapping", but will try for more concise solutions soo with more "folding".

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
